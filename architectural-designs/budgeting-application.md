### **Updated Budgeting Application Design with Expense Management**  

---

## **Problem Statement (Revised)**  
Managing daily finances is often complex for small households. Many struggle to track expenses, create budgets, and reconcile bank statements. Existing solutions are either too rigid or require manual data entry, leading to inefficiencies.  

This budgeting application aims to simplify personal finance management by enabling users to:  
- Enter and manage bank details.  
- Manually upload and parse bank statements.  
- Automatically categorize transactions.  
- Set up budgets and track expenses.  
- Manage daily expenses with categorized tracking.  

By integrating expense management, users can directly record spending and compare it against their budgets.
